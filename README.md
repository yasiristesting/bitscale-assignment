## 📦 Getting Started

`To get started with the Bitscale Assignment, follow these steps:`

### ✅Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed

### 💻 Installation

- Install dependencies: 
```sh
npm install
````
- Start the development server:
```sh
npm run dev
```

## Note - 
- The project is currently designed for desktop view only and is not fully responsive. Additionally, I feel the assignment requirements could be more detailed and include more challenging features to implement. The current scope didn't pose much of a challenge, and I believe a more demanding assignment would have made the work more engaging and enjoyable. That said, I have completed all the tasks as specified, and I hope you find the result satisfactory.
